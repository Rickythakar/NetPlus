#NetworkGeography

This lesson will talk about the distance that data can be shared - 


Personal Area Network (PAN) - Smallest type of wired or wireless network and covers the least amount of area.
	Usually covers about 10 feet or less 
		A good example of this can be Bluetooth or USB


Local Area Network (LAN) - Connects components within a limited distance
	Generally covers up to a few hundred feet depending on the cabling
	Cat5 generally goes up to a hundred while fiber optic can go further. 
Examples of this can include - small offices or 1 floor of an office building.

Networks can consist of Ethernet or Wi-Fi depending on how you want to setup the network.
ETHERNET STANDARD - IEEE 802.3
WIFI - IEEE  802.11

Additional examples of LAN include - The internal wired or wireless in your office building or school classroom or even at home. 


Campus Area Network (CAN) - Connects LANs that are building-centric across a university, industrial park, or business park.
