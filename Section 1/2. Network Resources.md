#NetworkResources 

This section will talk about how we share data 
Think about how data is being moved around the network.
Broken down into two main models - 
The Client/Server Model
The Peer-to-Peer Model

Client/Server Model - Uses a dedicated server to provide access to files, scanners, printers, and other resources.
	Administration and backup are pretty easy here as there is 1 central machine (the server) that all of the resources are sitting on. 
	We can configure the server and you have configured all of the accesses. 
Client/Server Benefits - 
	Gives us centralized administration  
	Easier Management 
	Better scalability 

Client/Server Drawbacks 
	Higher cost - requires dedicated hardware/software 
	Requires specialized OS
	Requires dedicated resources 

Client server is still the leading model used by business networks


Peer-to-Peer Model 
	Peers share resources (files/printers) directly with others

Administration and backup is difficult since the files are located on different machines and different places.
This is also a drawback with Peer-to-Peer
For example Napstar was a music sharing peer-to-peer where each person part of the network gave and received files.
This type of network costs less - 

The benefits of Peer-To-Peer 
	Lower cost
	No Dedicated Resources
	No Specialized OS
	Decentralized Management 
	Inefficient for large networks 
	Poor Scalability 


Basically these two types of networks are direct oppposites of each other. In the exam it is important to understand this as well as the different benefits and drawbacks
