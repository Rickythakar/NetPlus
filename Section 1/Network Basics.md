#NETWORKBASICS

Networks are used to transfer data from machine to another

Client - A device used by an end-user to access the network 
Examples - Workstation, laptop, smart phone or any other terminal device 

A client can be any device that connect to any device 


Server - A device that provides resources to the rest of the network.
Different servers provide different functions using dedicated hardware or specialized software. 
Examples can include email servers, client servers, printer servers, etc.

Hub - Older technology that connects network devices together.
Hubs can be interconnected to provide more ports using a daisy chain effect. Hubs can lead to increased network errors. 
Hubs receives information and rebroadcasts it.

Wireless Access Points (WAP) - A device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network. 
Commonly used at homes, small businesses, colleges, and enterprises.

Switch - A device that connects network devices together. (Like a next generation hub)
Switches can learn which devices are on which ports. 
Switches don't have to rebroadcasts the information is receives. 

Switches can also be considered smart hubs - as they provide more security and more efficiency.

Router - Connects two different networks together and forwards traffic to and from a network. 
Modern routers use IP Addresses 

Media - Connects two devices or a device to a switch port.
Examples can include - Copper cables, fiber optic cables, radio waves (wi-fi).
Each type of media has its own strengths and limitations. 
For example copper can be very cheap to use but does not go as far. Fiber optic can go far but it can be expensive.

Wide Area Network Link (WAN) - Physically connects two geographically dispersed networks. 
For example the internet is a big series of WAN links -
Connects an internal network to an external one.
